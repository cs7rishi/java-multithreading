Core Problem for race condition
# Shared Resource between thread
i.e InventoryCounter making items member shared between thread too

#Items++ and item--
>Are happening in the same time
>Are not atomic operations

Atomic Operation:
>An operation or set of operation is considered atomic, if it appears
to the rest of the system as if it occurred at once.
>Single step- "all or nothing"
>No intermediate states

i.e Item++ Not an atomic operation:
1.Get the value of items            currentValue <- 0
2.Increment current value by 1      newValue <- currentValue + 1 = 1
3.Store the result into items       items <- newValue = 1
