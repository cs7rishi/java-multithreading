******Threads Coordination using Joins*******

How we can guarantee that a thread upon which we depends completes it work,
by the time we expected

Thread Coordination, Why do we need it ?
1. Different threads run independently
2. Order of execution is out of control

Thread Coordination, Naive Solution
Scenario Thread B response depends on Thread A response

Thread B runs in a loop and checking if Thread A's result
is ready, this is extremely inefficient and CPU wasteful

Better Solution:

Thread B goes to sleep and let the Thread A finished it result
than Thread B wakes up
